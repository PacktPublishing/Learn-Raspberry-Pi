## About the Video Course
A comprehensive course that gets you started with the Raspberry Pi and building your own mini projects in it. It is packed with step-by-step instructions and working examples. The Raspberry Pi is used to interact with attached electronics by the use of its GPIO pins for multiple use cases, mainly home automation and robotics. You will explore the new Raspberry Pi Zero W, which has an added wireless LAN and Bluetooth connectivity. By the end of the course, you will be able to build your own real-world projects on the Raspberry Pi.
